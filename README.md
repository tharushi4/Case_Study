# Online Banking System Performance Simulation

This project simulates the performance of an Online Banking System under various user load conditions.  
It models how users (customers) arrive, wait, and are served by the systemâ€™s servers, then measures performance metrics such as average waiting time, throughput, and average queue length

## Objective
To evaluate the system performance under different levels of user load (Low, Medium, High, Peak) using queue simulation techniques.

## Requirements

Before running the simulation, make sure you have:

- **Python 3.8+**
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install simpy numpy matplotlib
